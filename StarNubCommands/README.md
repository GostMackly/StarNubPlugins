StarNub
=======
Starnub Commands Plugin was created to separate the commands from the StarNubPlugin.
This will allow new commands to be added while the server is running without restarting
the entire server. You can find more information at www.StarNub.org. This plugin is 
packaged by default with the StarNub Server and cannot be removed. It is an essential Plugin.
